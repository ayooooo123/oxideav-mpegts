//! Container [`Demuxer`] implementation reading 188-byte MPEG-TS
//! packets from a [`ReadSeek`] source.
//!
//! Wire layout per ISO/IEC 13818-1 — TS packet → PAT (PID 0) → PMT
//! (PID from PAT) → one elementary stream per `(elementary_pid,
//! stream_type)` pair → PES packets reassembled across TS packets
//! per PID → an [`oxideav_core::Packet`] per PES emitted to the
//! pipeline.
//!
//! ## Scope
//!
//! * Multi-program transport streams. The PAT's full program list is
//!   enumerated as [`TsProgram`] records ([`MpegTsDemuxer::programs`]);
//!   the default [`open`] path demuxes the first program, and
//!   [`MpegTsDemuxer::open_program`] selects any other by its
//!   `program_number` (§2.4.4.5).
//! * Multi-TS-packet PAT / PMT via [`crate::PsiSectionAssembler`] —
//!   sections that overflow the ~184-byte per-TS payload budget
//!   (common for PMTs with rich descriptor blocks) are reassembled
//!   across as many same-PID continuation packets as the section
//!   spans, per §2.4.4. Multi-section tables (`last_section_number >
//!   0`) still pick the first section — the table-level cross-section
//!   join is a separate follow-up.
//! * Per-PID streams. Streams whose [`StreamType`] maps to an audio /
//!   video / subtitle [`CodecParameters`] surface as
//!   [`StreamInfo`]s the muxer can write; streams whose type we don't
//!   handle (interactive graphics, private data) are silently
//!   dropped — their PES packets never reach `next_packet`.
//!
//! ## Time base
//!
//! TS PTS / DTS are in 90 kHz units. Each [`StreamInfo`] uses
//! `TimeBase::new(1, 90_000)` and packet timestamps are the raw
//! 33-bit values without rescaling — downstream muxers do their own
//! base conversion.
