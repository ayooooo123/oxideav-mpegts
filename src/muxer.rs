//! Container [`Muxer`] implementation that writes elementary-stream
//! [`Packet`]s into a 188-byte MPEG-TS file per ISO/IEC 13818-1.
//!
//! Scope:
//!
//! * Synthesises a PAT (`PID 0x0000`) listing every program's
//!   `(program_number, pmt_pid)` pair, and one PMT per program on its
//!   own PID, on `write_header`. The single-program `open` factory
//!   groups all streams into `program_number` 1 (PMT PID 0x0100);
//!   [`MpegTsMuxer::with_config`] takes a [`MpegTsMuxConfig`] of several
//!   [`ProgramSpec`]s for a genuine multi-program transport stream. PSI
//!   sections too long for one packet split across multiple TS packets
//!   per §2.4.4 — PUSI + `pointer_field` on the first, continuation on
//!   the rest.
//! * When a program carries a [`ServiceSpec`], a DVB Service Description
//!   Table (`PID 0x0011`) is emitted with a `service_descriptor` per
//!   service (ETSI EN 300 468 §5.2.3).
//! * Wraps each [`Packet`] in a PES envelope with PTS (and DTS when
//!   set), then fragments the PES into 188-byte TS packets — first
//!   packet has `payload_unit_start_indicator = 1`, continuations
//!   have it clear. Tail packets get an adaptation-field stuffing
//!   pass so the byte count lands on the 188-byte boundary.
//! * Per-PID continuity counters increment 0..0xF and wrap.
//! * Each program's PCR PID (its first video track by default) carries a
//!   PCR adaptation field on every PES start, and standalone PCR-only
//!   packets are injected on that PID whenever the inter-PCR interval
//!   would exceed the §2.7.2 bound (0,1 s), tracked independently per
//!   program and driven off PTS progression.
//! * The PAT / PMTs / SDT are re-emitted mid-stream at a configurable
//!   PTS interval (default ~200 ms; see
//!   [`MpegTsMuxer::set_psi_repetition_interval`]) so a receiver tuning
//!   in mid-file re-acquires the tables quickly, and once more at
//!   `write_trailer`.
//!
//! * A keyframe-flagged [`Packet`] (`PacketFlags::keyframe`) sets the
//!   `random_access_indicator` (§2.4.3.5) on the first TS packet of
//!   its PES envelope, so a receiver can locate random-access points
//!   without parsing the elementary stream. On the PCR PID the
//!   indicator is only emitted when that packet also carries a PCR,
//!   per the §2.4.3.5 constraint.
//! * [`MpegTsMuxer::signal_splice_after`] arms a §2.4.3.5 splicing
//!   point after the next written frame: its PES envelope's payload
//!   packets carry `splice_countdown` down to zero on the last one,
//!   optionally with the seamless `splice_type` / `DTS_next_AU`
//!   extension and the negative post-splice countdown.
//! * A frame whose payload exceeds the 16-bit `PES_packet_length`
//!   budget on a bounded (non-video) stream_id splits across several
//!   PES envelopes (§2.4.3.7) — timestamps on the first, none on the
//!   continuations.
//! * [`MpegTsMuxer::set_mux_rate`] enables CBR pacing on the §2.4.2
//!   T-STD delivery schedule: byte-clock PCRs, null-packet stream-time
//!   fill, per-class delivery leads (0.25 s video / 40 ms audio
//!   hold-back), and §2.4.2.3 transport-buffer spacing for audio and
//!   PSI packets.
//!
//! Out of scope:
//!
//! * MPEG-DASH-style time slicing, PES-CRC, or scrambling.
//! * Adaptation-field discontinuity / private-data flags on the write
//!   path (the [`crate::AdaptationFieldSpec`] builder covers them for
//!   callers assembling their own packets).
//!
//! CodecId → MPEG-TS `stream_type` (Table 2-29 + HDMV extension
//! 0x80..0xFF). The reverse mapping is performed at `open`; unknown
//! codecs surface as `Error::Unsupported`. The full list mirrors the
//! demuxer's `codec_params_for_stream_type` so a demux + mux
//! round-trip preserves the codec set on the disc.
