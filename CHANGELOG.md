## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The registry's `mpegts` demuxer (`open`) is now `ParsedDemuxer`: every
  PES goes through FFmpeg 2da55bf's parser stage, ported under LGPL-2.1-or-
  later in `src/ff/` and `src/parsed.rs`. H.264, MPEG-1/2 video, MPEG
  audio, ADTS AAC, AC-3 and E-AC-3 come out as the packets `av_read_frame`
  returns — one access unit or audio frame each, with FFmpeg's PTS, DTS,
  duration, key flag and cross-stream order; other codecs keep one packet
  per PES. Opening runs `avformat_find_stream_info`'s read-ahead and fills
  width, height, pixel format, frame rate, sample rate, channels and the
  MPEG audio layer into `StreamInfo`; on a seekable input demuxing then
  starts over at the first byte, as `estimate_timings_from_pts` does.
  `MpegTsDemuxer` keeps returning one packet per PES.
- `Demuxer::packet_metadata().container_keyframe` reports the
  random_access_indicator of the PES a packet started in.
- AC-3 / E-AC-3 in private PES (`stream_type` 0x06) are identified by the
  DVB AC-3 (0x6A) and enhanced AC-3 (0x7A) descriptors or the `AC-3` /
  `EAC3` registrations, and ATSC `stream_type` 0x87 is E-AC-3 (FFmpeg's
  DESC_types, REGD_types and MISC_types).
- Recognize DVB subtitles in private PES (`stream_type` 0x06) only when
  PMT descriptor 0x59 identifies a subtitle service. Expose `dvb_subtitle`,
  service languages and five-byte composition-page / ancillary-page /
  subtitling-type extradata records.
- Identify DTS audio carried as private PES (`stream_type` 0x06). A DVB
  DTS_descriptor (tag 0x7B) or a registration descriptor `DTS1`/`DTS2`/
  `DTS3` names it directly. Private PES with no codec-naming descriptor
  (none, or only alignment / language / bitrate / STD / stream
  identifier) is identified from its payload at open: up to 5 MB of
  transport stream is read ahead until four DTS frames chain (ETSI TS
  102 114 core and extension substream headers), taking sample rate and
  channels from the core header. Streams still unidentified after 64 KiB
  of payload are dropped as before and the rest renumbered; every PES
  read during the probe is delivered by `next_packet` in order.

### Changed

- License: `MIT AND LGPL-2.1-or-later` (the FFmpeg port; see README).
- A PES that states its length is returned once its last byte arrives,
  as FFmpeg's `mpegts_push_data` emits it, not at the PID's next unit
  start.
- A PES with only a PTS gets DTS = PTS, as FFmpeg sets it.
- MPEG-1 video streams (`stream_type` 0x01) start as MPEG-2 in the
  parser and are named `mpeg1video` from a sequence header without an
  extension, as FFmpeg's ISO_types does.
- A PID the PMT lists twice keeps one stream, decided as FFmpeg's pmt_cb
  decides it: an entry with another stream type resets the codec (kept if
  the type names none) and reopens the probe; descriptors name a codec
  only while it is unknown or the probe is open. So a later entry with
  the same type does not replace a codec a descriptor already named
  (FATE's `ac3/mp3ac325-4864-small.ts` changes type and becomes AC-3).
- Empty PES (no payload byte) are no packets, as in FFmpeg.

### Fixed

- Opening is bounded on input that never ends the read-ahead: the PAT
  and PMT searches stop after 128 MiB (`ResourceExhausted`), and the
  stream-info read-ahead after 128 MiB of input or 64 MiB of queued
  packets (each charged its payload and bookkeeping) — endless null
  packets after a PMT, or endless tiny PES, no longer read or queue
  without end.
- A parser unit longer than 32 MiB is a `ResourceExhausted` error, after
  the packets before it; it was dropped silently.
- A 204-byte packet needs only its 188-byte TS packet: input that ends
  inside the trailer keeps it, as FFmpeg's `read_packet` does.
- ADTS: channel configuration 7 is eight channels and configuration 0
  takes its count from the program config element, as FFmpeg's decoder
  reports them (it was the raw configuration value).
- H.264: the SPS and PPS the read-ahead finds are kept
  (`extract_extradata`) and loaded by every parser opened afterwards —
  after the read-ahead and after a seek — so units before the next
  in-band SPS/PPS are parsed and timed as FFmpeg times them.
- Video whose codec states no frame rate is timed with the rate FFmpeg
  estimates from the DTS while reading ahead (`ff_rfps_add_frame` /
  `ff_rfps_calculate`, then the `r_frame_rate` default), which also
  becomes the stream's frame rate.
- H.264 without a bitstream restriction gets the reorder depth FFmpeg's
  decoder learns from picture order (`h264_select_output_frame`), so DTS
  it reconstructs match.
- The ported files carry every copyright notice of their FFmpeg sources.
- A partial packet at the end of the input (FATE's
  `h264/h264_intra_first-small.ts` ends 40 bytes into one) ends the
  stream instead of failing it with "short read at packet boundary",
  as FFmpeg's `read_packet` turns a short read into `AVERROR_EOF`; so
  does running out of input while resyncing.
- PES that start before the first PAT/PMT are delivered: once the PMT
  is read, demuxing starts over at the first byte, as FFmpeg's
  `mpegts_read_header` seeks back after probing.
- Respect nonzero PES lengths when extracting payloads so TS stuffing
  does not reach decoders. Preserve all DVB PES framing and segment bytes
  across TS packet boundaries, including the last PES flushed at EOF.
- `PesReassembler` no longer keeps continuation payload past a PES's
  declared `PES_packet_length` until the next PUSI: memory stays at the
  PES's own size however many same-PID packets follow. A PES without a
  length is held up to `pes::MAX_UNBOUNDED_PES_BYTES` (32 MiB), checked
  before its bytes are kept; a longer one is dropped with
  `TsError::Unsupported` and the next PES reassembles as before.

### Added

- `ViolationCounts::pcr_extension_out_of_range`: typed tally for PCR
  samples whose 9-bit `program_clock_reference_extension` wire value
  exceeds the §2.4.3.4 bound of 299. The validator has folded such
  values into the modulus since the daily-fuzz underflow fix; the
  nonconformance is now surfaced as its own counter instead of
  passing silently.
- Muxer `stream_type` coverage for the remaining codec ids the
  demuxer emits, so demux → remux round-trips: `mp1`/`mp2`/`mp3`
  (ISO/IEC 11172-3 audio, 0x03), `aac` (ADTS, 0x0F), `mpeg1video`
  (0x01), `mpeg4` (0x10), `jpeg2000` (0x21).

### Added

- **A/65 Table 6.25 descriptor coverage completes.** The PSIP
  descriptor walker types the `ATSC_private_information_descriptor`
  (tag `0xAD`, A/53 Part 3 §5.8.2 Table 6.1) — the SMPTE-RA
  `format_identifier` (the §2.6.8 registration code space) plus the
  opaque `private_data_byte` run, with a short body falling back to
  `Raw` — and recognises the `E-AC-3_audio_stream_descriptor` (tag
  `0xCC`, §6.9.1.2) with its A/52-annex-G body surfaced raw exactly
  like the AC-3 form. Every descriptor A/65 Table 6.25 places in a
  PSIP loop now has a typed or tag-recognised decode.

- **Video transport-buffer pacing closes the last mux-side T-STD
  hole.** `MpegTsMuxer::set_video_max_bitrate(stream_index, rmax)`
  declares a video stream's §2.4.2.3 `Rmax`; in CBR mode that PID's
  TS packets are then spaced against the 512-byte `TBn` at the
  spec-formula drain `Rxn = 1.2 × Rmax` — exactly the pacing the
  audio and pooled-system branches already get. Without the
  declaration a mux rate above the stream's `Rxn` overflows `TBn` on
  any back-to-back PES envelope (pinned: 8 KB frames on a 20 Mbit/s
  wire against an `Rmax`-4-Mbit/s chain model peak at 600+ bytes);
  with it the same plan is zero-violation under `analyze_tstd` with
  the video TB peak ≤ 512. PCR-only packets on a paced PCR PID
  (video-hinted or audio) are now paced and booked against the same
  TB account — they are whole TS packets entering `TBn` like any
  payload packet, and leaving them unbooked let the analyzer read
  ~2 packets more backlog than the pacer budgeted. The hint
  validates its target (video-only, non-zero, known index); an
  `Rmax` below the stream's true rate surfaces as the existing
  cannot-deliver-in-time error rather than silent violations. The
  `mux_roundtrip` structure-aware fuzz plan gained the hint as a
  dimension: hinted CBR plans are T-STD-checked against the tighter
  `Rmax`-based video chain model rather than the generous wire rate
  (≈ 490 000 plans locally clean).

- **The Table 2-39 descriptor set is closed out.** The `descriptor`
  module decodes the last ten program / program-element descriptors
  the staged ISO/IEC 13818-1 edition defines — the §2.6.28–§2.6.53
  ISO/IEC 14496 carriage family: `private_data_indicator` (0x0F,
  opaque 32-bit value), `MPEG-4_video` (0x1B) and `MPEG-4_audio`
  (0x1C, with a Table 2-62 `(profile, level)` classifier covering all
  eight assignment blocks and rejecting the reserved gaps), `IOD`
  (0x1D — `Scope_of_IOD_label`/`IOD_label` typed, the ISO/IEC 14496-1
  §8.6.3.1 InitialObjectDescriptor surfaced raw), `SL` (0x1E,
  `ES_ID` ↔ PID binding), `FMC` (0x1F, 3-byte `(ES_ID,
  FlexMuxChannel)` records), `External_ES_ID` (0x20), `Muxcode`
  (0x21) and `FmxBufferSize` (0x22 — their 14496-1 §11.2.4.3 / §11.2
  internal structures surfaced raw but tag-recognised), and
  `MultiplexBuffer` (0x23 — 24-bit MBn size + 24-bit TBn→MBn leak
  rate in 400 bit/s units with a bits-per-second helper, feeding the
  §2.11.3.9 extended T-STD model). Fixed-size bodies reject
  wrong-length payloads to `Raw` (FMC additionally requires the
  3-byte stride). Pinned by decode tests for every tag, the Table
  2-62 classification sweep, and a wrong-size fallback battery.

- **DCCT + DCCSCT — the A/65 table set is complete.** The `atsc`
  module gains the optional directed-channel-change pair on the base
  PID: `DirectedChannelChangeTable` (§6.7 Table 6.15, `table_id 0xD3`)
  parses the per-test `dcc_context` (Table 6.16 Temporary Retune vs
  Channel Redirect), the 10-bit from/to major·minor virtual-channel
  numbers, the GPS `dcc_start_time`/`dcc_end_time` window, and the
  ANDed selection-term loop — each term's `dcc_selection_type`
  classifies per Table 6.17 (`DccSelectionCategory`, including the
  exclusion/non-member forms and Viewer Direct Select buttons A–D),
  with helpers unpacking the 64-bit `dcc_selection_id` as postal-code
  text (§6.7's right-justified, `'?'`-wild-carded forms) or Table 6.19
  right-justified genre codes, plus the Table 6.18 demographic bit
  assignments as `dcc_demographic` constants; descriptor loops surface
  at term, test, and table level (the DCC departing/arriving request
  descriptors already decode typed). `DccSelectionCodeTable` (§6.8
  Table 6.23, `table_id 0xD4`) parses the Table 6.24 code-set updates
  — new genre category / state / county (10-bit location code), each
  with its MSS name — skipping reserved update types via
  `update_data_length` with the raw body kept. Both parsers reject
  non-zero `dcc_subtype` / `dccsct_type` (only zero is defined; §6.8
  expects non-zero DCCSCT types discarded) and any loop slack. New
  `MgtTableEntry::dcct_dcc_id` / `is_dccsct` classifiers cover the
  Table 6.3 rows `0x1400 + dcc_id` and `0x0005`. Both tables join the
  hostile mutation battery (seeded well-formed sections) and the
  `parse_units` fuzz walk. Pinned by wire round-trips covering both
  contexts, 10-bit channel-number extremes, all three DCCSCT update
  types, an unknown-type skip, and truncation / overrun / slack /
  bad-subtype rejections.

- **ATSC PSIP table family (A/65:2013).** New `atsc` module closing
  the North-American SI gap: parsers for the base-PID (`0x1FFB`)
  tables — STT (§6.1, GPS seconds + `GPS_UTC_offset` + annex-A
  daylight-saving accessors, `gps_to_unix` helper), MGT (§6.2, the
  PID/version/size directory with typed Table 6.3 classifiers for
  EIT-k / event-ETT-k / RRT-region entries), TVCT/CVCT (§6.3, one
  shared wire shape with the cable-only `path_select` /
  `out_of_band` bits and the CVCT one-part channel-number formula),
  RRT (§6.4, region name + dimensions + rating values) — and the
  MGT-announced guide tables ATSC EIT (§6.5, per-`source_id` events
  with 14-bit `event_id`, GPS `start_time`, 20-bit duration, MSS
  title) and ETT (§6.6, `ETM_id`-keyed with Table 6.14 channel/event
  decomposition). The §6.10 Multiple String Structure decodes the
  Table 6.41 Unicode range-select modes and UTF-16 mode `0x3F`;
  annex-C Huffman segments surface raw with their
  `compression_type`. A separate PSIP descriptor walker
  (`iter_atsc_descriptors` — the §6.9 tags sit in the MPEG-2
  user-private range, so they stay out of the MPEG/DVB descriptor
  table) types caption_service (608/708 forms), content_advisory,
  extended_channel_name, service_location, time_shifted_service,
  component_name, DCC departing/arriving requests,
  redistribution_control, and genre. Every parse enforces the §4.1
  generic PSIP section: CRC-32 verified, `protocol_version` must be
  zero. Pinned by hand-built sections covering both VCT flavours,
  MGT directories, RRT dimension/value nesting, EIT + content
  advisory, event/channel ETMs, both caption-service forms, and
  CRC / truncation rejection.

- **Annex-C Huffman text decompression for PSIP strings.** The A/65
  annex-C standard order-1 Huffman code tables (Table C4
  program-title / Table C6 program-description — 1745 entries across
  2 × 128 prior-character contexts) are transcribed as numeric data
  (`atsc_huffman`), and `MssSegment::decode` now resolves
  `compression_type` `0x01`/`0x02` segments (text modes `0x00` and
  the §C.3 `0xFF` spelling both accepted): decoding starts from the
  Terminate context, symbol 27 escapes to one uncompressed 8-bit
  character (§C.2.1), characters ≥ 128 force the following character
  uncompressed, symbol 0 terminates, and the output is ISO/IEC
  8859-1. Transcription is pinned structurally — every multi-entry
  context satisfies the Kraft equality exactly (a complete
  prefix-free tree), every context can escape, spot literals match
  the printed table — plus encode∘decode round-trips (escape and
  raw-follow paths included), corrupt-stream sweeps, and MSS-level
  integration for both table types.

- **Two-generation remux gates for §2.4.3.5 / §2.7.6 signalling.**
  New round-trip tests pin that a full remux generation (mux → demux
  → mux → demux) preserves the random-access grid — the wire RAI
  count stays exactly the keyframe count in both generations, the
  demuxer folds every RAI back into a keyframe flag, and per-stream
  `(pts, payload, keyframe)` sequences are identical across the
  generation — and carries a time-base discontinuity through: both
  generations stay validator-conformant across the backward base
  jump with exactly one `discontinuity_indicator` PCR packet, and
  the re-signalled break lands where the demuxed timeline steps
  backward. Black-box cross-check: a 6 s CBR remux of a
  tool-generated MPEG-2 elementary stream (SDT + advancing TDT
  aboard) read back through an independent validator binary with all
  100 frames decoded, zero container errors, and the reconstructed
  transport rate within 0,25 % of the configured 2 Mbit/s.

- **The ATSC PSIP surface rides the hostile batteries.** The
  deterministic hostile-input sweep gains a PSIP leg: well-formed
  STT / MGT / TVCT / EIT seed sections under seeded byte mutations
  (with the CRC re-stamped on half the rounds so mutations reach the
  deep loop parsers), truncations, and pure noise — panic-free,
  bounded work. The `parse_units` fuzz target now also drives every
  A/65 table parser, the multiple string structure with full text
  decode, and the PSIP descriptor walk.

- **CAT + TDT/TOT emission on the mux side.**
  `MpegTsMuxConfig.ca_descriptors` (raw §2.6.16 `CA_descriptor` TLVs,
  built with `build::ca_descriptor`) makes the muxer emit a
  Conditional Access Table (§2.4.4.6) on PID 0x0001 with the same
  header / repetition / trailer cadence as the PAT; PID 0x0001 is a
  §2.4.2.3 system PID, so in CBR mode the CAT packets ride the pooled
  `TBsys`/`Bsys` accounts and the repetition-burst budget counts them.
  `MpegTsMuxConfig.time` (a `TimeSpec`: the UTC instant of the first
  frame plus optional §6.2.20 offset entries) emits a TDT — and, with
  offsets, a TOT — on PID 0x0014 (EN 300 468 §5.2.5/§5.2.6); each
  re-emission advances the carried `UTC_time` by the elapsed stream
  time with annex-C MJD arithmetic, so the wall clock tracks the
  delivery schedule like a live transmission's (pinned across a
  midnight/MJD rollover). Round-trip pinned through the CAT/TDT/TOT
  parsers, `validate_ts`, and a CBR run under `analyze_tstd`.

- **Write-side coverage for every remaining parsed table.** The `build`
  module now mirrors the whole `psi` parse surface: `build_cat`
  (§2.4.4.6) and `build_tsdt` (§2.4.4.12) long-form descriptor-loop
  sections, `build_bat` (EN 300 468 §5.2.2 — the NIT-shaped bouquet
  section, reusing `NitTsEntry`), `build_sit` (§5.2.10 / §7.1.2 — the
  partial-TS description with its transmission-info loop and typed
  `SitServiceEntry` service loop), and the short-form family via a
  shared §5.2.5–§5.2.9 envelope: `build_tdt`, `build_tot` (with the
  CRC-32 trailer inside `section_length`), `build_rst` (reusing the
  parser's `RstEntry`), `build_st`, and `build_dit`. New descriptor
  builders back them: `ca_descriptor` (§2.6.16 — CAT/PMT CA
  signalling), `local_time_offset_descriptor` (§6.2.20, with a typed
  `LocalTimeOffsetSpec` and BCD `HHMM` encoding),
  `partial_transport_stream_descriptor` (§7.2.1),
  `extended_event_descriptor` (§6.2.15 — item loop + free text),
  `content_descriptor` (§6.2.9), `parental_rating_descriptor`
  (§6.2.28), `stuffing_descriptor` (§6.2.40), and a generic
  `raw_descriptor` escape hatch. Every builder is round-trip pinned
  against its parser, including the EN 300 468 annex-C worked example
  (`1993-10-13 12:45:00` → `0xC0 7912 4500`) on the TDT wire bytes and
  a TOT CRC-corruption rejection.

### Fixed

- **Multi-program CBR muxes keep every program's PCR cadence alive.**
  The byte clock is shared, so a program whose frames run out early
  still ages in stream time — but standalone PCR maintenance only ran
  for the program owning the frame being written, so an idle
  program's PCR_PID fell silent (a >0,1 s unsignalled inter-PCR gap
  the crate's own validator flags per §2.7.2). The CBR null-burn and
  pre-write checks now maintain the §2.7.2 bound for ALL programs.
  Found by the `mux_roundtrip` fuzz target; pinned by
  `cbr_multi_program_keeps_idle_programs_pcr_cadence`.

- **Standalone periodic PCRs now carry the same `PTS − ~10 ms` stamp
  as inline PES PCRs.** The two sources interleave on one PCR_PID:
  a non-PCR-PID sibling stream writing first at time `P` emitted a
  bootstrap standalone PCR stamped `P`, then the PCR PID's own PES at
  the same instant carried `P − 900` — a backward time-base step
  §2.4.3.5 only permits under a signalled discontinuity, which the
  §2.7.2 modular interval check reads as a ~26,5 h gap. Both paths
  now stamp `(PTS − 900).max(0)` and record the same base value.
  Found by the `mux_roundtrip` fuzz target.

- **CBR PSI is bounded against the pooled §2.4.2.3 `Bsys`, not just
  the transport buffer.** The system branch's main buffer is 1536
  bytes drained at equation 2-7's slow `Rsys` (`max(80 kbit/s,
  rate/500)`), so an aggressive PSI repetition interval could outrun
  the drain even with TBsys-spaced packets. The pacer now carries a
  pooled `Bsys` account: system-PID PSI packets null-pace against it,
  and a mid-stream repetition is deferred (retried on the next write)
  unless the whole PAT+PMT burst fits without null-burning — so
  frames are never delayed behind a PSI refresh. Found by the
  `mux_roundtrip` fuzz target as a `Bsys` overflow under
  `analyze_tstd`.

- **Inline PES PCRs ring modulo 2^33 like the timestamps they
  accompany.** A caller writing an extended timeline past the 33-bit
  wrap had its PES timestamps ringed on the wire (§2.4.3.7) but the
  accompanying PCR stamp errored with "PCR base exceeds 33 bits"
  instead of ringing; the §2.7.2 bookkeeping stays on the extended
  caller timeline so the interval check survives the wrap. Found by
  the `mux_roundtrip` fuzz target on a wrap-crossing plan.

- **A first coded DTS appearing only after a 2^33 wrap stays on the
  PTS's extended timeline.** §2.4.3.7 gives DTS and PTS one shared
  time base, but the demuxer's per-PID DTS tracker anchored an
  independent epoch at the first raw value it saw — so a stream that
  wrapped before ever coding a DTS reported the post-wrap DTS ~26,5 h
  behind its PTS. The DTS tracker now seeds its wrap epoch from the
  same PES's extended PTS. Found by the `mux_roundtrip` fuzz target;
  pinned by `post_wrap_first_dts_stays_on_extended_timeline`.

- **Sparse-cadence programs backfill their §2.7.2 PCR chain instead
  of overshooting it.** The periodic standalone-PCR trigger fired
  only once a write's own stamp had already drifted past the bound,
  so a program whose active cadence was coarser than the trigger
  (e.g. a 7 700-tick audio step after its video ended) put a
  9 031-tick (>0,1 s) gap on the wire. The chain is now stepped
  forward with standalone PCRs just inside the bound until the
  upcoming stamp is reachable — for sibling-triggered emissions and
  for the PCR PID's own inline stamp alike. Found by the
  `mux_roundtrip` fuzz target.

- **`StuffingTable::parse` no longer indexes past a headerless
  slice.** A section shorter than the 3-byte `table_id` +
  `section_length` header of EN 300 468 §5.2.8 Table 11 (e.g. a
  1-byte `[0x72]` buffer) read `section[1]` before any length check
  and panicked. The bounds validation now runs first and the input
  errors as truncated. Found by the `parse_units` fuzz target;
  pinned by `st_headerless_slice_errors_not_panics`.

- **Undersized `section_length` claims no longer underflow the
  long-form CRC arithmetic.** A long-form section always spans the
  five fixed `table_id_extension` .. `last_section_number` bytes plus
  the CRC_32 inside its `section_length` count
  (§2.4.4.5–§2.4.4.11 / EN 300 468 §5.2), so any claim below 9
  cannot frame a section — yet `parse_section_header` accepted it and
  computed `total - 4` / sliced `body` with a debug-build subtract
  overflow (release: an out-of-bounds slice). Claims 0..9 now error
  as truncated. Found by the `parse_units` fuzz target; pinned by
  `undersized_section_length_claim_errors_not_panics`.

- **`extended_event_descriptor` decode no longer reads past a payload
  that ends at the item block.** The mandatory `text_length` byte
  follows the §6.2.15 item loop, but the bound allowed
  `length_of_items` to end exactly at the payload end and then
  indexed the missing byte. Such a descriptor now falls back to
  `DescriptorBody::Raw`. Found by the `parse_units` fuzz target;
  pinned by `extended_event_descriptor_missing_text_length_falls_back_to_raw`.

- **CBR PSI bursts now respect the pooled §2.4.2.3 system branch.**
  PID 0 (PAT), PID 1 (CAT), and every `program_map_PID` are
  transferred through ONE `TBsys`, but the CBR pacer budgeted each
  PSI PID a separate 512-byte transport buffer — and skipped pacing
  entirely before the byte clock anchored — so `write_header`'s
  PAT+PMT burst, an aggressive repetition interval, and the trailer
  re-emission could stack the pooled buffer to 541 bytes at high mux
  rates (a §2.4.2.6 TB-overflow the crate's own `analyze_tstd`
  flags). PSI on the system PIDs now paces against a single shared
  `TBsys` account, active from the first written byte (TB fullness
  depends only on byte deltas and the fixed rate — §2.4.2.2's byte
  position IS the arrival clock); DVB SI PIDs (SDT / NIT / EIT) keep
  their per-PID bound. Found by the `mux_roundtrip` fuzz target;
  pinned by `cbr_psi_bursts_respect_pooled_system_tb`.

### Added

- **cargo-fuzz harness (`fuzz/`) + daily Fuzz workflow.** Four
  structure-aware targets share the fleet 30-minute daily budget:
  `demux` — arbitrary hostile bytes through the conformance
  validator, the raw packet walk (PSI assembly across fragmented
  sections into every PSI/SI table parser with full descriptor
  walks, PES reassembly + header decode, PCR / continuity / PTS
  trackers), the §2.4.2 T-STD replay, and the typed demuxer battery
  (open, bounded drain, RAP index, all three seek paths) — panic-free
  contract; `parse_units` — hostile bytes straight into the
  standalone section / descriptor / PES / assembler / UTC-time
  parsers plus encode∘parse fixed-point asserts for `PesHeaderSpec`,
  `AdaptationFieldSpec`, and the PAT/PMT builders; `mux_roundtrip` —
  valid-by-construction multi-program plans (programs × streams ×
  frames × DVB SDT/EIT/NIT × splice / time-base-discontinuity / CBR
  / PSI-repetition / DTS / 33-bit-wrap knobs) must mux, validate
  conformant, satisfy the T-STD in CBR mode, and re-demux to the
  exact per-stream (PTS, DTS, payload, keyframe) sequence;
  `structured_mutate` — writer-shaped fixtures under fuzz-directed
  sync-byte kills, TS-header / section-header / CRC-region flips,
  packet drops / duplicates, truncation, and 192/204-byte reframing
  feed the full hostile battery. Committed corpus: named seeds plus
  the session's crash regressions.

- **Standalone PCR packets no longer break the continuity chain.**
  §2.4.3.3 forbids incrementing the continuity counter on a packet
  whose `adaptation_field_control` is `'10'` (no payload); the muxer
  was both consuming and advancing the PID's counter for injected
  PCR-only packets, making the next payload packet on the PCR PID
  look like a dropped packet to a §2.4.3.3-enforcing receiver. They
  now carry the last payload packet's counter value untouched;
  pinned by a validator check over a mux run that forces periodic
  standalone PCR injection.

### Added

- **Time-base discontinuity signalling on the mux side (§2.4.3.5 /
  §2.7.6).** `MpegTsMuxer::signal_time_base_discontinuity(program)`
  marks frames written afterwards as belonging to a new system time
  base: the next PCR on the program's PCR_PID — inline or standalone
  — carries `discontinuity_indicator = 1` (the §2.4.3.5 rule that
  the indicator rides the first packet containing a PCR of the new
  base), the §2.7.2 PCR bookkeeping restarts, and in CBR mode the
  byte clock re-anchors on the next timestamped frame after flushing
  any still-held old-base audio. Pinned: the indicator appears
  exactly once on a PCR-carrying packet right after the old-base
  PES run, `validate_ts` stays conformant across the break (its
  interval check resets on the signalled discontinuity), and a CBR
  mux across a backward base jump stays zero-violation under
  `analyze_tstd` (whose arrival clock applies the §2.4.2.2
  previous-rate rule at the break).

- **The T-STD model rides the hostile-input sweep.** `analyze_tstd`
  joins the deterministic mutation / noise / truncation sweeps: any
  input must produce an error or a finite, violation-capped report —
  never a panic or unbounded work.

- **Splice-signalling coherence checks in `validate_ts` (§2.4.3.5).**
  Three new `ViolationCounts` rules, tracked per PID across the
  stream: `splice_countdown_inconsistent` — an annotated
  `splice_countdown` value that contradicts the count of payload
  packets (duplicates and payload-less packets excluded) since the
  previous annotation, with sparse annotation and a fresh positive
  restart after a passed splicing point both accepted;
  `seamless_splice_run_broken` — once `seamless_splice` is signalled
  with a positive countdown, every subsequent `splicing_point_flag`
  packet through the countdown-zero packet must carry it with
  identical `splice_type` / `DTS_next_AU`; and
  `nonzero_splice_type_on_audio` — `splice_type` must be `'0000'`
  when the PID's PMT `stream_type` classifies it as audio. The
  muxer's own splice output passes all three (its tests run the
  validator); hand-built streams pin each violation and its clean
  counterpart.

- **CBR pacing on the mux side (§2.4.2 delivery schedule).**
  `MpegTsMuxer::set_mux_rate(Some(bit_rate))` turns the muxer into a
  constant-bit-rate packetizer whose byte position defines the
  §2.4.2.2 arrival clock: every PCR (inline on PES starts and
  standalone) is stamped from the byte clock at the PCR field's own
  byte offset, so the transport rate a receiver reconstructs from
  consecutive PCRs equals the configured rate exactly; null packets
  (PID 0x1FFF) burn stream time so each frame's first byte arrives
  0.25 s — never a full second — ahead of its decode time; PCR-only
  packets keep the §2.7.2 bound across null runs (~40 ms cadence);
  and audio / PSI packets are spaced with nulls whenever emitting one
  back-to-back would push that PID's §2.4.2.3 512-byte transport
  buffer past its size at the spec drain rates (2 Mbit/s audio,
  1 Mbit/s system). Delivery leads are per class: video rides the
  full 0.25 s, while non-video frames are *held* in a per-track
  queue and released 40 ms before their decode time — the §2.4.2.3
  audio main buffer is only 3584 bytes, so an audio stream riding
  the video lead would hoard several times `BSn` (observed in a
  black-box remux before the fix); held frames flush ahead of any
  packet that would pass their release point and drain fully at the
  trailer. `write_packet` errors when the byte clock has already
  passed a frame's decode time (rate too low). The CBR output is
  pinned conformant against the crate's own `analyze_tstd` model
  (video + audio + PSI chains, zero violations, audio Bn peak under
  1,5 KB and audio delay under 0.1 s), the packet-level
  `validate_ts`, and an exact demux round-trip. Black-box
  cross-check: a validator-muxed 3 s H.264 + AC-3 transport stream
  demuxed by this crate and remuxed CBR at 4 Mbit/s with a
  mid-stream seamless splice reads back through the validator with
  the same 75 video + 87 audio frame counts, zero decode errors,
  and the reconstructed rate at the configured value.

- **T-STD buffer model (§2.4.2).** New `tstd` module:
  `analyze_tstd(&[u8], &TStdConfig) -> TStdReport` replays a whole
  transport stream (any physical framing) through the Transport
  Stream system target decoder. The §2.4.2.2 arrival clock is
  reconstructed from the PCRs on the configured `PCR_PID` (equations
  2-1 to 2-5: piecewise-constant transport rate between PCR pairs,
  wrap-aware on the 33+9-bit field, and the discontinuity rule —
  the previous interval's rate carries across a signalled time-base
  change, with decode times re-anchored on the new base). Each
  configured elementary PID runs its §2.4.2.3 chain as a fluid
  (piecewise-linear) model: whole TS packets enter the fixed
  512-byte `TBn` and drain at `Rxn` FIFO; PES bytes continue into
  the main buffer `Bn` (audio — PES headers are held until the
  access-unit removal, per the audio rule) or into `MBn → EBn` via
  the leak method (`Rbxn`, PES headers discarded at transfer, EBn
  back-pressure stalling the leak); whole access units leave at
  their decode time (DTS when coded, else PTS; access units are
  PES-granular, timestamp-less continuation PES packets extend the
  open unit). `system_pids` share the `TBsys → Bsys` chain with the
  equation 2-7 `Rsys` drain. Violations follow §2.4.2.6: `TbOverflow`
  / `TbBusyOverOneSecond` (empty-once-a-second), `MainOverflow` /
  `MainUnderflow`, `MbOverflow` / `MbBusyOverOneSecond`,
  `EbUnderflow`, `DelayOverOneSecond` (`tdn(j) − t(i) ≤ 1 s`), and
  `BsysOverflow`, deduplicated per rule + PID with the worst figure
  kept and every occurrence counted. `TStdStreamModel::audio()`
  carries the spec-fixed non-ADTS numbers (`Rxn` 2 Mbit/s, `BSn`
  3584); `video_low_main_level` / `video_high_level` apply the
  §2.4.2.3 `Rxn = 1.2 × Rmax`, `Rbxn`, and `MBSn = BSmux + BSoh
  (+ VBVmax − vbv_buffer_size)` formulas over caller-supplied
  `Rmax` / VBV figures (the values live in ISO/IEC 13818-2 tables).
  Per-chain stats report peak `TBn` / main / `EBn` occupancy, access
  units, and worst delay. Pinned by hand-built rate-exact streams:
  a conformant audio stream and a conformant 25 fps video stream
  pass; a 40 Mbit/s audio burst trips `TbOverflow`, hoarded audio
  trips `MainOverflow`, late data `MainUnderflow`, a 2 s decode
  offset `DelayOverOneSecond`, an under-provisioned leak
  `EbUnderflow`; the clock survives a PCR wrap and a signalled
  discontinuity; PSI loads ride the system branch.

- **PES splitting on the mux path (§2.4.3.7).** A bounded-length
  (non-video) frame whose payload exceeds the 16-bit
  `PES_packet_length` budget — the field counts the 3 post-length
  header bytes, the optional PTS/DTS area, and the payload — now
  splits across several PES envelopes instead of erroring: the first
  carries the timestamps, continuations carry none (a PES packet need
  not hold a whole access unit; alignment is only promised by the
  `data_alignment_indicator`, which stays clear). Each envelope
  fragments into TS packets with its own PUSI, the frame's PCR /
  `random_access_indicator` ride the first envelope, and an armed
  splicing point annotates only the last — the splicing point sits
  after the frame's final byte. Video stream_ids keep the unbounded
  `PES_packet_length = 0` single-envelope form. Demux round-trip:
  the split envelopes surface as consecutive packets whose payloads
  concatenate to the original frame, the first with the PTS.

- **Splice-point mux API (§2.4.3.4 / §2.4.3.5 / Annex K).**
  `MpegTsMuxer::signal_splice_after(stream_index, SpliceSpec)` arms a
  splicing point immediately after the next written `Packet`'s PES
  envelope: its payload-carrying TS packets gain `splicing_point_flag`
  with a positive `splice_countdown` counting down to zero on the last
  one — whose last payload byte is the last byte of the coded frame by
  construction (one `Packet` = one PES + adaptation-field tail
  stuffing), and the next payload on the PID starts a PES packet, the
  two §2.4.3.5 alignment constraints. `SpliceSpec::seamless`
  (`SeamlessSpliceSpec { splice_type, dts_next_au }`) additionally
  rides the adaptation-field extension's `splice_type` / `DTS_next_AU`
  pair on every annotated packet, honouring the §2.4.3.5 rule that
  `seamless_splice_flag`, once set with a positive countdown, stays
  set through the countdown-zero packet (Annex K.1.2 seamless splicing
  point). `SpliceSpec::post_splice_packets` continues the annotation
  past the splicing point with the negative countdown (`-1`, `-2`, …)
  across following PES envelopes. A PES spanning more than 128
  payload packets starts the countdown at 127 (the field is a signed
  8-bit `tcimsbf`) on the 128th-from-last packet. Arming rejects a
  non-zero `splice_type` on a non-video stream (§2.4.3.5), over-width
  `splice_type` / `DTS_next_AU`, and unknown stream indices. Splice
  output is pinned §2.4.3.x-conformant via `validate_ts` and
  round-trips through the demuxer unchanged.

- **Keyframe-accurate, wrap-aware seeking.** `Demuxer::seek_to` now
  honours the core contract (nearest keyframe at or before the
  target) end to end: the PCR bisection compares every probed PCR on
  the extended 64-bit timeline (head-anchored zero-wrap modular
  delta), so a mid-stream `2^33` wrap no longer breaks the search
  invariant or the tail clamp; a windowed forward scan from the PCR
  landing then lands on the last access point at or before the
  target, with a doubling backoff for GOPs longer than the window and
  the cached full index as the definitive fallback / clamp-up path.
  Access points are tiered via the new `AccessPointKind`:
  §2.4.3.5 `random_access_indicator` announcements (landing anchored
  on the flagged packet so the emitted `Packet` re-derives its
  keyframe flag) over §2.4.3.7 data-aligned PES starts for
  indicator-less streams — a window-local aligned point never
  shadows an indicator keyframe further back — over the PCR-granular
  landing when neither is signalled. `RandomAccessPoint` gained the
  `kind` field and its `pts_90k` is now the **extended** PTS
  (B-frame-tolerant epoch-nearest unwrap), keeping the index ordered
  across a wrap; `seek_to_random_access` remains the strict
  §2.4.3.5-only surface. New `MpegTsDemuxer::seek_to_access_point`
  exposes the tiered search directly.
- **Post-seek timeline continuity.** `PtsTracker::seed(extended_hint)`
  re-enters a wrap epoch after a reposition: the first observation
  picks the epoch whose extended value lies nearest the hint, so
  packets demuxed after a seek past `2^33` continue the extended
  timeline instead of re-anchoring at small raw values. Every seek
  landing re-seeds the per-PID PTS/DTS trackers with the landed time
  and drops in-flight PES state (continuation bytes are discarded
  until the next PUSI, as after a §2.4.3.4 discontinuity). The
  stateless companion `clock::extend_near(raw, reference)` — extend a
  raw 33-bit timestamp to the wrap epoch nearest a reference — is
  public too; it is what the index scan unwraps B-frame-reordered PES
  times with.
- **Round-trip seek accuracy suite.** Self-muxed fixtures (the muxer
  writes PCR + indicator keyframes at known timestamps) pin the
  landing exactness: a 15-target CBR sweep and a 64 B–24 KiB VBR
  layout land exactly on the keyframe grid (worst delta under one
  GOP), a two-program mux proves the bisection follows the selected
  program's own `PCR_PID`, flag-less streams degrade to a PCR landing
  within one frame + T-STD offset of the target, seeking revives a
  demuxer that already streamed to EOF, and hand-rolled streams cover
  wrap-crossing seeks both directions, sparse-PCR exact landings,
  carrier-packet indicator anchoring, long-GOP backoff, clamp-up, and
  tier preference. Cross-checked black-box against a validator-muxed
  20 s H.264 transport stream: nine targets all landed exactly on the
  validator-reported keyframe grid.

- **Deterministic hostile-input sweeps.** A test-only module drives a
  seeded in-tree LCG through every parse surface — hundreds of
  mutated well-formed streams (built via the crate's own write path),
  pure-noise buffers, sync-aligned noise, truncations, an over-cap
  `section_length` claim, and mutated demuxer open/read/seek runs
  with hard iteration bounds — pinning the robustness contract: no
  panics, no unbounded work or allocation, errors instead of
  misbehaviour. Fixed seeds make any failure reproduce exactly.

- **Write-side PES header builder (§2.4.3.7 Table 2-17).**
  `PesHeaderSpec` encodes a complete PES packet with every optional
  header field the parser reads — scrambling control, priority,
  alignment, copyright, original_or_copy, PTS/DTS, ESCR (composed
  27 MHz tick, exact inverse of the decoder including the maximum
  42-bit value), ES_rate, typed DSM trick mode, additional_copy_info,
  previous_PES_packet_CRC, and the full `PES_extension` body (the
  parsed `PesExtension` doubles as the write spec) — plus both length
  forms: real 16-bit `PES_packet_length` and the unbounded `0` form
  (video stream_ids only, per §2.4.3.7) and the header-less
  stream_ids. Spec-violating requests are rejected with
  `TsError::InvalidField`: DTS without/equal-to PTS (§2.7.5), the
  forbidden zero `ES_rate`, field-width overflows, over-budget
  optional areas, and unbounded length on non-video IDs. The muxer's
  PES construction now goes through the shared builder (audio PES
  gain real lengths; video keeps the BD-style unbounded form).

- **Conformance validation report.** New `validate` module:
  `validate_ts(&[u8]) -> TsValidationReport` walks a stream (any of
  the three physical framings) in two passes — PSI discovery, then
  packet-level checks — and tallies normative-rule violations with
  bounded state: §2.4.3.3 continuity-counter errors (drops +
  over-cap duplicates, per PID and overall), Table 2-5 reserved
  `adaptation_field_control` packets, §2.4.3.5 adaptation-field length
  bounds (183 with AF-only control, ≤182 with AF+payload), §2.4.3.5
  field pairings (OPCR without PCR, `seamless_splice` without
  `splicing_point_flag`, RAI on a PCR PID without PCR fields), §2.7.2
  unsignalled inter-PCR gaps over 0,1 s (`MAX_PCR_INTERVAL_27MHZ`),
  `transport_error_indicator` packets, and PAT/PMT sections failing
  CRC / length checks. Per-PCR-PID reports carry sample counts, the
  max inter-PCR interval, signalled discontinuities, and a §2.4.2.2
  transport-rate estimate; the report also exposes per-PID stats,
  null-packet counts, PAT repetition gaps, and an `is_conformant()`
  verdict. The muxer's own output is pinned conformant in tests;
  hostile-input tests cover CC gaps, oversized PCR gaps (signalled vs
  not), pairing violations, corrupt PSI CRC, garbage, and truncation.

- **192/204-byte physical packet tolerance.** The demuxer now detects
  and strips the two common non-188 framings: 192-byte source packets
  (a 4-byte prefix word ahead of each packet — the `.m2ts` shape) and
  204-byte packets (a 16-byte error-correction trailer appended by
  transmission systems). `TsPacketLayout` names the three framings,
  `detect_packet_layout` classifies a probe buffer by its sync-byte
  grid (≥2 consistent packets required), and
  `MpegTsDemuxer::packet_layout()` reports the detection. The whole
  read layer — streaming reads, garbage resync (double-sync check one
  packet *stride* apart), the PCR duration probe, the PCR-anchored
  binary-search seek, and the random-access index — walks the physical
  grid while every consumer keeps seeing plain 188-byte packets. The
  container probe now scores all three framings.

- **Typed DSM trick-mode decode (§2.4.3.7).** `DsmTrickMode` decodes
  the raw `DSM_trick_mode` byte into the Table 2-20
  `trick_mode_control` variants — fast-forward / fast-reverse (with
  `FieldId` per Table 2-21, `intra_slice_refresh`, and the Table 2-22
  `CoefficientSelection` frequency truncation), slow-motion /
  slow-reverse (5-bit `rep_cntrl`), freeze-frame (`FieldId`), and the
  reserved control values with their raw tail bits. `to_byte()` is the
  write-side inverse (all 256 byte values are stable through a
  decode–encode–decode cycle), and `PesPacket::trick_mode()` lifts the
  already-parsed raw byte.

- **Random-access index + keyframe-accurate seek.**
  `MpegTsDemuxer::random_access_points()` builds (once, in a single
  forward pass with the demux cursor restored) a typed index of every
  §2.4.3.5 `random_access_indicator` packet on the selected program's
  elementary PIDs — byte offset, PID, stream index, and the PTS of the
  announced PES packet, resolved per the "next PES packet to start"
  rule so indicators riding payload-less carrier packets still get the
  following PES start's timestamp. `seek_to_random_access(stream_index,
  target_90k)` then lands the demuxer on the last access point at or
  before the target (optionally restricted to one stream — typically
  the video track), so the next demuxed PES is a keyframe; it is the
  keyframe-accurate companion to the PCR-granular `seek_to`, and
  reports `Unsupported` for indicator-less streams so callers can fall
  back.

- **Keyframe ↔ `random_access_indicator` round trip.** The muxer sets
  the §2.4.3.5 `random_access_indicator` on the first TS packet of a
  keyframe-flagged `Packet`'s PES envelope (on the PCR PID only when
  that packet also carries the PCR fields, per the §2.4.3.5
  constraint). `PesReassembler` folds the indicator into a new
  `PesPacket::random_access` field — honouring the "next PES packet to
  start" rule, so a flag on a payload-less carrier packet ahead of the
  PES start still tags it — and the demuxer surfaces it as the core
  `Packet` keyframe flag. The muxer's hand-rolled adaptation-field
  bytes (PES stuffing + PCR-only packets) now go through the
  `AdaptationFieldSpec` builder, and the PCR wire encoding is the
  shared `encode_clock_reference`.

- **Write-side adaptation-field builder.** `AdaptationFieldSpec` /
  `AdaptationFieldExtensionSpec` encode the complete §2.4.3.4 Table 2-6
  surface — discontinuity / random-access / ES-priority indicators, PCR,
  OPCR, signed `splice_countdown`, `transport_private_data`, and the
  adaptation-field extension (`ltw_valid_flag` + 15-bit `ltw_offset`,
  22-bit `piecewise_rate`, `seamless_splice` with 4-bit `splice_type` +
  33-bit `DTS_next_AU`) — including the `adaptation_field_length == 0`
  single-stuffing-byte form and `0xFF`-stuffed padding to a requested
  size (the §2.4.3.5 PES tail-alignment mechanism). §2.4.3.5-forbidden
  combinations are rejected with the new `TsError::InvalidField`: OPCR
  without PCR, `seamless_splice` without a `splice_countdown`
  (`seamless_splice_flag` requires `splicing_point_flag`), field-width
  overflows, and content or padding beyond the 184-byte AF ceiling
  (`MAX_ADAPTATION_FIELD_LEN`). Every spec round-trips bit-exactly
  through `TsPacket::parse`. The 6-byte PCR/OPCR wire shape is exposed
  as `encode_clock_reference`.

- **End-to-end mux → demux round-trip harness.** A single test builds a
  two-program transport stream carrying SDT + NIT + present/following EIT
  + per-stream `stream_identifier` descriptors and PES with distinct
  PTS/DTS, then demuxes it and asserts every program, service name,
  network name, event, component tag, and timestamp reads back
  identically.
- **Richer PMT ES_info descriptor emission.** Every muxed elementary
  stream now carries an auto `stream_identifier_descriptor` (tag 0x52)
  with a per-program 1-based `component_tag`, alongside the existing
  ISO-639 language descriptor. `ProgramSpec.es_descriptors` lets a caller
  attach arbitrary extra ES_info descriptor bytes per stream (built with
  the `build` module — teletext / subtitling / AC-3 / …), appended after
  the auto ones. Round-trips through the demuxer's
  `PmtStream::iter_descriptors`.
- **DVB NIT + EIT emission on the mux side.** `MpegTsMuxConfig.network`
  (a `NetworkSpec`) makes the muxer emit a Network Information Table on
  PID 0x0010 naming the network and listing this transport stream (with
  a `network_name_descriptor` plus caller-supplied delivery-system /
  service_list descriptors). Each `ProgramSpec.events` (a `Vec<EventSpec>`)
  makes the muxer emit a present/following Event Information Table on PID
  0x0012 keyed on the program's `program_number`, each event carrying a
  `short_event_descriptor`. Both round-trip through the demuxer's
  `NetworkInformationTable::parse` / `EventInformationTable::parse`.
- `build::short_event_descriptor` (tag `0x4D`) and
  `build::service_list_descriptor` (tag `0x41`) round-trip builders.
- **PSI repetition intervals.** The muxer now re-emits the PAT, every
  PMT, and the SDT mid-stream whenever the running PTS advances past a
  configurable interval (default ~200 ms / 18000 ticks of the 90 kHz
  clock), so a receiver tuning in mid-file re-acquires the program tables
  quickly (cf. DVB TR 101 290 §5). `MpegTsMuxer::set_psi_repetition_interval`
  widens or disables it; `None` restores the header/trailer-only
  behaviour.
- **Multi-program muxing.** `MpegTsMuxer::with_config` takes a
  `MpegTsMuxConfig` describing several `ProgramSpec`s — each with its own
  `program_number`, PMT PID, PCR PID, and set of input streams. The PAT
  now lists every program's `(program_number, pmt_pid)` pair, one PMT is
  emitted per program on its own PID, and PCR insertion / the §2.7.2
  inter-PCR interval bound is tracked independently per program. The
  single-program `open` factory is unchanged (one program, PMT PID
  0x0100). Round-trips through the demuxer's `programs()` enumeration and
  per-program `open_program` selection.
- **DVB SDT emission.** A `ProgramSpec` carrying a `ServiceSpec`
  (`service_type` + provider / service names) makes the muxer emit a
  Service Description Table on PID 0x0011 with a `service_descriptor`
  per service, at header and trailer. Reads back through
  `ServiceDescriptionTable::parse`.
- The muxer's PAT / PMT construction now goes through the shared `build`
  module (removing an inlined CRC-32 duplicate).
- New `build` module — the write-side mirror of the `psi` / `descriptor`
  parse surface. Pure `&[…] -> Vec<u8>` builders emit spec-conformant
  bytes that read back identically through the matching parser:
  - **Descriptor TLV builders**: `registration_descriptor` (§2.6.8),
    `iso639_language_descriptor` (§2.6.18),
    `stream_identifier_descriptor` (0x52), `service_descriptor` (0x48),
    `network_name_descriptor` (0x40), `bouquet_name_descriptor` (0x47),
    `teletext_descriptor` (0x56), `subtitling_descriptor` (0x59),
    `ac3_descriptor` (0x6A), `enhanced_ac3_descriptor` (0x7A),
    `dts_descriptor` (0x7B), `aac_descriptor` (0x7C).
  - **Long-form PSI section builders**: `build_pat` (multi-program),
    `build_pmt` (per-stream `ES_info` loops), `build_sdt`, `build_nit`,
    and `build_eit_pf` (present/following), each emitting `table_id`
    through the MPEG-2 CRC-32 trailer.
  - DVB 40-bit MJD + BCD `UTC_time` encoding (the inverse of
    `decode_utc_time`, ETSI EN 300 468 annex-C integer formula) drives
    the EIT `start_time` field.
  - `RunningStatus::to_bits` — the inverse of `from_bits` — so an SDT /
    EIT parse → build round-trip is bit-exact.
- The DVB `data_broadcast_descriptor` (tag `0x64`, ETSI EN 300 468
  §6.2.11 Table 31) — the long form of the data_broadcast_id_descriptor
  — now decodes to a typed `DescriptorBody::DataBroadcast` carrying the
  `data_broadcast_id`, `component_tag`, the length-prefixed selector
  field, and the language-tagged free-text description. Truncated
  length prefixes fall back to `Raw`.
- The DVB `extension_descriptor` (tag `0x7F`, ETSI EN 300 468 §6.2.16
  Table 54) now decodes its `descriptor_tag_extension` envelope (clause
  6.3 Table 109) into a typed `DescriptorBody::Extension`. The selector
  field is exposed both raw and, for `descriptor_tag_extension == 0x06`,
  decoded into a typed `supplementary_audio_descriptor` (§6.4.11
  Table 153 — `mix_type`, `editorial_classification`, and the optional
  overriding `ISO_639_language_code`). Unknown extension sub-tags keep
  their selector bytes verbatim.
- Every public descriptor body type is now re-exported from the crate
  root (previously a subset was reachable only via the `descriptor::`
  module path).
- Six more PMT / EIT DVB descriptors now decode to typed bodies (ETSI
  EN 300 468): `service_move_descriptor` (tag `0x60`, §6.2.36 — the
  post-move `(original_network_id, transport_stream_id, service_id)`
  triple), `short_smoothing_buffer_descriptor` (tag `0x61`, §6.2.38 —
  `sb_size` / `sb_leak_rate` event bit-rate signalling),
  `scrambling_descriptor` (tag `0x65`, §6.2.32 — the `scrambling_mode`),
  `data_broadcast_id_descriptor` (tag `0x66`, §6.2.12 —
  `data_broadcast_id` + selector bytes), `ancillary_data_descriptor`
  (tag `0x6B`, §6.2.2 — the Table-16 ancillary-data bit-flags with
  per-field accessors), and `AAC_descriptor` (tag `0x7C`, annex H —
  `profile_and_level` plus the optional flag byte / `AAC_type` /
  `additional_info`). Malformed bodies still fall back to `Raw`.
- The four DVB NIT delivery-system descriptors now decode to typed
  bodies (ETSI EN 300 468 §6.2.13 / §6.2.17):
  `satellite_delivery_system_descriptor` (tag `0x43`, §6.2.13.2 — the
  DVB-S/S2 carrier: packed-BCD frequency / orbital position / symbol
  rate, polarization, roll-off, modulation system + type, inner FEC),
  `cable_delivery_system_descriptor` (tag `0x44`, §6.2.13.1 — the DVB-C
  carrier: packed-BCD frequency / symbol rate, outer + inner FEC,
  modulation), `terrestrial_delivery_system_descriptor` (tag `0x5A`,
  §6.2.13.4 — the DVB-T carrier: 10-Hz-unit centre frequency, bandwidth,
  priority, time-slicing / MPE-FEC indicators, constellation, hierarchy,
  HP/LP code rates, guard interval, transmission mode, other-frequency
  flag), and `frequency_list_descriptor` (tag `0x62`, §6.2.17 — the
  multiplex's additional centre frequencies with their `coding_type`).
  Frequency / symbol-rate fields are surfaced as their raw packed-BCD
  integers; the spec's §6.2.13 worked examples (cable `0x03120000` →
  312 MHz, satellite `0x01175725` → 11.75725 GHz, symbol rate
  `0x0274500` → 27.4500 Msymbol/s) are pinned as tests.
- Seven more DVB SI descriptors now decode to typed bodies (ETSI
  EN 300 468): `service_list_descriptor` (tag `0x41`, §6.2.35 — the
  NIT/BAT `(service_id, service_type)` channel list),
  `country_availability_descriptor` (tag `0x49`, §6.2.10 — the
  intended/not-intended country list with its polarity flag),
  `linkage_descriptor` (tag `0x4A`, §6.2.19 — the
  `(transport_stream_id, original_network_id, service_id, linkage_type)`
  header plus the type-specific body + private-data run as raw
  `link_data`), `component_descriptor` (tag `0x50`, §6.2.8 — the
  `(stream_content, stream_content_ext, component_type)` editorial
  classification with `component_tag`, language, and free text),
  `CA_identifier_descriptor` (tag `0x53`, §6.2.5 — the associated
  `CA_system_id` list), `parental_rating_descriptor` (tag `0x55`,
  §6.2.28 — per-country `(country_code, rating)` entries with a
  `minimum_age_years()` Table-83 helper), and
  `private_data_specifier_descriptor` (tag `0x5F`, §6.2.31 — the 32-bit
  specifier that scopes following private descriptors). Each surfaces a
  new `DescriptorBody` variant; malformed bodies still fall back to
  `Raw`.
- `MpegTsDemuxer` now supports time-based seeking. `Demuxer::seek_to`
  performs a PCR-anchored binary search over the byte stream
  (ISO/IEC 13818-1 §2.4.2.2) — MPEG-TS carries no in-container index, so
  the demuxer brackets the requested PTS between the open-time head/tail
  PCR anchors and bisects the byte range, scanning forward to the next
  PCR on the `PCR_PID` at each step and steering by its `base_90khz`. It
  lands on the packet boundary of the last PCR at or before the target,
  resets every per-PID PES reassembler and the PTS/DTS/PCR trackers, and
  returns the landed PCR base. Targets outside the bracket clamp to the
  first / last PCR; a stream with fewer than two PCRs returns
  `Error::Unsupported`. PTS and PCR share the 90 kHz time base so no
  per-stream rescale is needed.
- `MpegTsDemuxer` now reports container duration. `Demuxer::duration_micros`
  is computed once at open from the head-to-tail PCR span on the selected
  program's `PCR_PID` (ISO/IEC 13818-1 §2.4.2.2): the first PCR is scanned
  forward from the start of the stream and the last from a growing trailing
  window, and the 27 MHz tick delta (`base × 300 + extension`, wrap-aware
  via the modular delta) converts to microseconds. The same figure is
  mirrored onto every `StreamInfo.duration` in 90 kHz units. Returns
  `None` when the program declares no PCR_PID, the stream carries fewer
  than two PCR samples, or the source is not seekable to its end.
- `partial_transport_stream_descriptor` (tag `0x63`, ETSI EN 300 468
  §7.2.1 / Table 165) decode — the SIT-only descriptor that conveys the
  rate / smoothing parameters for controlling play-out and copying of a
  partial TS. `DescriptorBody::PartialTransportStream` exposes the
  22-bit `peak_rate` (with a `peak_rate_bits_per_second` helper), the
  22-bit `minimum_overall_smoothing_rate`, and the 14-bit
  `maximum_overall_smoothing_buffer`, both with `*_undefined` predicates
  for the §7.2.1 all-ones sentinels (`0x3F_FFFF` / `0x3FFF`). Bodies
  shorter than the 8-byte fixed payload fall back to `Raw`.
- `stuffing_descriptor` (tag `0x42`, ETSI EN 300 468 §6.2.40 / Table 98)
  decode — the descriptor-loop padding / invalidation mechanism that may
  ride in any of the NIT / BAT / SDT / EIT / SIT loops.
  `DescriptorBody::Stuffing` surfaces the raw `stuffing_byte` run (no
  meaning per §6.2.40); a zero-length body is legal.
- `SelectionInformationTable` — the DVB Selection Information Table
  (SIT, ETSI EN 300 468 §5.2.10 / §7.1.2 / Table 164) carried on the
  fixed PID `0x001F` (`SIT_PID`) with `table_id == 0x7F`
  (`SIT_TABLE_ID`). The SIT describes the services and events carried by
  a **partial** TS — the kind produced when a single service is
  extracted from a full multiplex (e.g. a personal-video recording).
  Unlike the DIT it is a **long-form** section: `parse` CRC-verifies the
  standard `version_number` / `section_number` / `last_section_number`
  header (the same way as PAT/PMT/SDT), reads the SIT-wide
  transmission-info descriptor loop (lifted by
  `SelectionInformationTable::iter_descriptors` — the SIT-only
  `partial_transport_stream_descriptor`, tag `0x63`, rides here), then a
  loop of `SitService` entries each pairing a `service_id` and the
  original present event's typed `running_status` with its own
  descriptor loop (`SitService::iter_descriptors`). A wrong `table_id`,
  a bad CRC, or a descriptor-length overrun is rejected with `TsError`.
- `StuffingTable` — the DVB Stuffing Table (ST, ETSI EN 300 468 §5.2.8
  / Table 11) with `table_id == 0x72` (`ST_TABLE_ID`). The ST is the
  mechanism that **invalidates** existing sections at a delivery-system
  boundary (e.g. a cable head-end): when one section of a sub_table is
  overwritten every section of that sub_table is stuffed out so the
  `section_number` integrity is retained. It is a **short-form** section
  whose `section_syntax_indicator` may be `0` or `1`, with no version /
  section header and **no CRC**, so `StuffingTable::parse` surfaces the
  `section_syntax_indicator` flag plus the raw `data_byte` run (which
  has no meaning per §5.2.8). The ST may appear on any SI PID; a wrong
  `table_id` or a `section_length` overrun is rejected with `TsError`.
- `DiscontinuityInformationTable` — the DVB Discontinuity Information
  Table (DIT, ETSI EN 300 468 §5.2.9 / §7.1.1 / Table 163) carried on
  the fixed PID `0x001E` (`DIT_PID`) with `table_id == 0x7E`
  (`DIT_TABLE_ID`). The DIT is inserted at transition points in a
  **partial** TS where SI information may be discontinuous. It is a
  **short-form** section (no version / section header, **no CRC**) with
  a `section_length` fixed at `0x001`; `parse` decodes the single body
  byte's top bit into `transition_flag` — `true` for a change of the
  originating source (originating TS / position change, e.g. a
  time-shift), `false` for a change of the selection only — and ignores
  the 7 `reserved_future_use` bits. A wrong `table_id` or an empty body
  is rejected with `TsError`. New public constants `DIT_TABLE_ID` /
  `DIT_PID` / `SIT_TABLE_ID` / `SIT_PID`.
- `RunningStatusTable` — the DVB Running Status Table (RST, ETSI
  EN 300 468 §5.2.7 / Table 10) carried on the fixed PID `0x0013`
  (`RST_PID`) with `table_id == 0x71` (`RST_TABLE_ID`). The RST is the
  fast event-status update channel — a dedicated table refreshes the
  running status of one or more events quicker than a full EIT cycle
  when an event starts early or late. Unlike the long-form tables it is
  a **short-form** section (`section_syntax_indicator == 0`, no version
  / section header and **no CRC**), so the whole body is a flat run of
  fixed 9-byte `RstEntry` records, each locating an event by the
  `(transport_stream_id, original_network_id, service_id, event_id)`
  tuple and carrying its updated `RunningStatus`. A wrong `table_id`, a
  body that isn't a whole number of entries, or a `section_length` that
  overruns the section are all rejected with `TsError`.
- `BouquetAssociationTable` — the DVB Bouquet Association Table (BAT,
  ETSI EN 300 468 §5.2.2 / Table 4) carried on the SDT's fixed PID
  `0x0011` (`BAT_PID`) with `table_id == 0x4A` (`BAT_TABLE_ID`). A
  *bouquet* groups services into a marketable package that may cross
  network boundaries, independent of the physical multiplex layout the
  NIT describes. `BouquetAssociationTable::parse` reads a section into
  the `bouquet_id` (from `table_id_extension`), the standard version /
  section bookkeeping, the bouquet-level descriptor loop, and a typed
  `transport_stream_loop` of `BatTransportStream` entries — each pairing
  `(transport_stream_id, original_network_id)` with its own descriptor
  loop (`BatTransportStream::iter_descriptors`). The body is byte-for-
  byte the same shape as the NIT, so sections may be reassembled with
  `PsiSectionAssembler` before parsing and a wrong `table_id` / bad CRC
  is rejected with `TsError`.
- `BouquetNameDescriptor` — typed view of the DVB
  `bouquet_name_descriptor` (tag `0x47`, ETSI EN 300 468 §6.2.4 /
  Table 21). The entire descriptor payload is the `bouquet_name` run
  (no inner length prefix), exposed as raw bytes — the annex-A
  character-table selection is left to the caller, consistent with the
  `network_name_descriptor`. This is the bouquet-level descriptor a BAT
  usually carries to name the bouquet, lifted through
  `BouquetAssociationTable::iter_descriptors`.
- Multi-program demux selection — `MpegTsDemuxer` now collects every
  non-network program the PAT advertises (§2.4.4.5) into a typed
  `TsProgram { program_number, pmt_pid }` list exposed via
  `programs()`. The default `open` path keeps first-program-wins;
  `MpegTsDemuxer::open_program(input, program_number)` selects any
  other program (with `selected_program()` reporting the active
  choice). Previously the parsed PAT was discarded and only the first
  program was ever reachable.
- Demux-path timing reconstruction — the selected program's `PCR_PID`
  (§2.4.4.9) now feeds a `PcrTracker` for 27 MHz clock recovery
  (`last_pcr()` / `pcr_pid()`), and each emitted packet's 33-bit
  PTS/DTS is unwrapped through a per-PID `PtsTracker` (§2.4.3.7) onto
  the monotonic 64-bit extended timeline so a `2^33` ring wrap no
  longer surfaces as a backward jump. The first observed PTS anchors
  `StreamInfo.start_time`.
- `PtsTracker` (clock module) — per-PID PTS / DTS unwrapper per
  ISO/IEC 13818-1 §2.4.3.7. PES timestamps are 33-bit 90 kHz values that
  wrap every ~26.5 h; the tracker turns the raw values seen on one PID
  into a monotonic 64-bit **extended** timeline (`extended()`), counting
  `2^33` wraps (`TIMESTAMP_MODULUS_90KHZ`) while distinguishing a genuine
  wrap from a backward splice / seek discontinuity via the new
  `TimestampEvent` (`First` / `Forward` / `Wrapped` / `Backward`).
- Full ISO/IEC 13818-1 Table 2-29 `stream_type` mapping — [`StreamType`]
  now names the complete base assignment range `0x01..=0x26` (MPEG-1/2/4
  video + audio, AAC-ADTS / AAC-LATM, private sections / PES, MHEG,
  DSM-CC carriers, the `0x15..=0x19` metadata carriers, IPMP, AVC / SVC /
  MVC / MVCD, JPEG 2000 video, stereoscopic MPEG-2 / AVC views, HEVC and
  its temporal subset) plus AVS video (`0x42`) — on top of the existing
  HDMV-extended Blu-ray range. New classification predicates
  `is_metadata()` and `is_private()` join `is_video` / `is_audio` /
  `is_subtitle`; `is_subtitle` now also covers MPEG-4 timed text. The
  demuxer's `stream_type` → `CodecParameters` routing gains MPEG-1 video,
  MPEG-1/2 audio, AAC, MPEG-4 visual, JPEG 2000, stereoscopic views and
  MPEG-4 text arms, with an explicit drop for non-A/V payloads.
- DVB PMT elementary-stream descriptors (EN 300 468) — the tags a
  demultiplexer needs to route a private-data PES to the right decoder:
  `stream_identifier_descriptor` (`0x52`, §6.2.39 → `component_tag`),
  `teletext_descriptor` (`0x56`, §6.2.43 → per-language EBU teletext
  pages with split `teletext_type` / `teletext_magazine_number`),
  `subtitling_descriptor` (`0x59`, §6.2.41 → per-language EN 300 743
  subtitle services with `composition_page_id` / `ancillary_page_id`),
  `AC-3_descriptor` (`0x6A`, annex D Table D.6 → flag-gated
  `component_type` / `bsid` / `mainid` / `asvc`),
  `enhanced_AC-3_descriptor` (`0x7A`, annex D Table D.7 → the AC-3 set
  plus `mixinfoexists` and three independent-substream fields), and
  `DTS_descriptor` (`0x7B`, annex G Table G.1 → the 40-bit
  `sample_rate_code` / `bit_rate_code` / `nblks` / `fsize` /
  `surround_mode` / `lfe_flag` / `extended_surround_flag` bitfield head).
  Each surfaces a new `DescriptorBody` variant; malformed bodies fall
  back to `Raw`.
- `content_descriptor` (tag `0x54`, EN 300 468 §6.2.9) decode — the DVB
  genre classifier carried in the EIT event loop alongside the short /
  extended event descriptors. `DescriptorBody::Content` exposes a flat
  array of `ContentNibble` records, each pairing the two 4-bit content
  nibbles (Table 29 genre index) with the broadcaster-defined
  `user_byte`. Genre strings are left to the caller; an empty or
  odd-length body falls back to `Raw`.
- `extended_event_descriptor` (tag `0x4E`, EN 300 468 §6.2.15) decode —
  the long-form companion to the `short_event_descriptor`, carried in
  the EIT event loop. `DescriptorBody::ExtendedEvent` exposes the
  `descriptor_number` / `last_descriptor_number` association pair, the
  language code, a `Vec` of two-column `(item_description, item)` pairs,
  and the non-itemized free text. Item/text runs stay raw (annex A).
- DVB Time and Date Table (TDT, EN 300 468 §5.2.5) and Time Offset
  Table (TOT, §5.2.6) parsers — both short-form sections on PID
  `0x0014`. `TimeDateTable` / `TimeOffsetTable` decode the 40-bit
  MJD/BCD `UTC_time` via a shared `decode_utc_time` helper; the TOT
  additionally verifies its CRC-32 and exposes a descriptor loop.
- `local_time_offset_descriptor` (tag `0x58`, EN 300 468 §6.2.20)
  decode — per-country offset entries
  (`DescriptorBody::LocalTimeOffset`).

### Added

- `NetworkInformationTable` — the DVB Network Information Table (NIT,
  ETSI EN 300 468 §5.2.1 Table 3) carried on the fixed PID `0x0010`
  ([`NIT_PID`]). `NetworkInformationTable::parse` reads a section into
  the `network_id` (from `table_id_extension`), the standard version /
  section bookkeeping, the network-level descriptor loop, and a typed
  `transport_stream_loop` of `NitTransportStream` entries. Both NIT
  `table_id` classifications are accepted — actual network (`0x40`,
  `NIT_ACTUAL_TABLE_ID`) and other networks (`0x41`,
  `NIT_OTHER_TABLE_ID`), with `other_network` recording which —
  matching the predicate `NetworkInformationTable::is_nit_table_id`.
  Each `NitTransportStream` pairs `(transport_stream_id,
  original_network_id)` — the combination the spec notes uniquely
  identifies a TS throughout the application area — with its own
  descriptor loop, walkable via `NitTransportStream::iter_descriptors`;
  the network-level loop is walkable via
  `NetworkInformationTable::iter_descriptors`. The two-level descriptor
  layout (network-wide loop then per-TS loops) mirrors the PMT's
  program-info / ES-info split, and sections may be reassembled with
  `PsiSectionAssembler` before parsing like the other long-form tables.
- `NetworkNameDescriptor` — typed view of the DVB
  `network_name_descriptor` (tag `0x40`, ETSI EN 300 468 §6.2.27
  Table 81). The entire descriptor payload is the `network_name` run
  (no inner length prefix), exposed as raw bytes — the EN 300 468
  annex-A character-table selection is left to the caller, consistent
  with the `service_descriptor` / `short_event_descriptor` name fields.
  This is the network-level descriptor a NIT usually carries to name
  the delivery system, wired through the shared descriptor decoder so
  `NetworkInformationTable::iter_descriptors` lifts it.
- `VideoWindowDescriptor` — typed view of the §2.6.14
  video_window_descriptor (tag `0x08`, Table 2-50). Surfaces the
  four-byte body as the 14-bit `horizontal_offset`, the 14-bit
  `vertical_offset` (the top-left position of the stream's display
  window on the grid per §2.6.15), and the 4-bit `window_priority`
  (overlap order, `0` lowest through `15` always-visible). The body
  shares the target_background_grid_descriptor's wire layout (14 + 14 +
  4 bits across four bytes, both offsets big-endian and spanning a byte
  boundary), and the table carries no reserved bits, so all 32 payload
  bits are read. Bodies shorter than four bytes fall back to
  `DescriptorBody::Raw`. Wired through `PmtStream::iter_descriptors` and
  `ProgramMapTable::iter_program_descriptors` alongside the existing tag
  set. This completes the §2.6.12–§2.6.15 grid/window descriptor pair:
  a target_background_grid_descriptor (tag `0x07`) establishes the
  display grid and a video_window_descriptor places the associated
  stream's window onto it.
- `EventInformationTable` — the DVB Event Information Table (EIT,
  ETSI EN 300 468 §5.2.4 / Table 7), carrying chronological per-event
  metadata for the services in a multiplex. Carried on the fixed PID
  `EIT_PID` (`0x0012`); `parse` accepts all four `table_id`
  classifications — present/following on the actual TS
  (`EIT_ACTUAL_PF_TABLE_ID`, `0x4E`) and other TSs (`0x4F`), and the
  event-schedule ranges `0x50`–`0x5F` (actual) / `0x60`–`0x6F` (other)
  — recording `other_transport_stream` and `schedule`. It CRC-verifies
  the long-form section header the same way as PAT/PMT/SDT, reads
  `transport_stream_id` / `original_network_id` /
  `segment_last_section_number` / `last_table_id`, then a loop of
  `EitEvent` entries (`event_id`, decoded `start_time`, `duration`,
  `running_status`, `free_CA_mode`, and a per-event descriptor block).
  A truncated event, a wrong `table_id`, or a bad CRC are rejected with
  `TsError`.
- `EitDateTime` / `EitDuration` — the EIT `start_time` 40-bit field is
  decoded per EN 300 468 annex C: 16 bits of Modified Julian Date
  converted to a Gregorian `(year, month, day)` via the integer
  conversion formula, plus 24 bits of 4-bit BCD UTC time. The
  all-ones sentinel surfaces as `None`. `duration` is the 24-bit BCD
  hours/minutes/seconds, with `EitDuration::as_seconds`. The spec
  worked examples (`0xC0 7912 4500` → 1993-10-13 12:45:00 and
  `0x01 4530` → 01:45:30) are pinned as tests.
- `ShortEventDescriptor` (DVB descriptor tag `0x4D`, EN 300 468
  §6.2.37 / Table 93) decoded by the descriptor layer — the 24-bit
  `ISO_639_language_code` plus the raw `event_name` / `text` byte runs
  (DVB text strings, annex A character-table selection left to the
  caller). Carried in the EIT event loop, this is the source of an
  event's human-readable name for the `oxideav remux bluray://` path.
- `ServiceDescriptionTable` — the DVB Service Description Table (SDT,
  ETSI EN 300 468 §5.2.3 / Table 5), the first Service Information
  table beyond the ISO/IEC 13818-1 PSI set. Carried on the fixed PID
  `SDT_PID` (`0x0011`); sections describing the actual TS use
  `SDT_ACTUAL_TABLE_ID` (`0x42`) and those describing other TSs use
  `SDT_OTHER_TABLE_ID` (`0x46`). `parse` accepts both table_ids
  (recording which in `other_transport_stream`), CRC-verifies the
  long-form section header the same way as PAT/PMT, then reads
  `original_network_id` plus a loop of `SdtService` entries
  (`service_id`, `EIT_schedule_flag`, `EIT_present_following_flag`,
  `running_status` as the typed `RunningStatus` enum from Table 6,
  `free_CA_mode`, and a per-service descriptor block). A truncated
  service entry, a wrong `table_id`, or a bad CRC are rejected with
  `TsError`.
- `ServiceDescriptor` (DVB descriptor tag `0x48`, EN 300 468 §6.2.33 /
  Table 88) decoded by the descriptor layer — `service_type` plus the
  raw `service_provider_name` / `service_name` byte runs (DVB text
  strings left undecoded; charset selection is the caller's concern).
  Lifted through `SdtService::iter_descriptors`, this is the source of
  a service's human-readable name for the remux→MKV title-naming path.
- `TransportStreamDescriptionTable` — the Transport Stream Description
  Table (TSDT, §2.4.4.12 / Table 2-30-1). The TSDT is the fourth
  ISO/IEC 13818-1 PSI table after PAT / CAT / PMT: an optional table on
  the fixed PID `TSDT_PID` (`0x0002`) with `table_id == TSDT_TABLE_ID`
  (`0x03`) that carries a single `descriptor()` loop (§2.6) applying to
  the **entire** Transport Stream. Structurally it mirrors the CAT — a
  long-form section header (`table_id` … `last_section_number`) whose
  bytes 3–4 are reserved (no `table_id_extension` meaning), then the
  descriptor block, then CRC-32. `parse` rejects a wrong `table_id` as
  `TsError::Unsupported`; `iter_descriptors` lifts the body to typed
  `Descriptor` records, and a section that overflows one TS payload
  reassembles through the existing `PsiSectionAssembler` before
  parsing. New public constants `TSDT_TABLE_ID` and `TSDT_PID`.
- `PesExtension` — full decode of the `PES_extension` body (§2.4.3.7,
  Table 2-17 concluded), replacing the bare
  `pes_extension_present: bool` on `PesPacket` with
  `pes_extension: Option<PesExtension>`. All five flag-gated
  sub-fields are surfaced: the 16-byte `PES_private_data`, the raw
  `pack_header()` bytes (length-prefixed by `pack_field_length`,
  carried verbatim without interpretation), the
  `program_packet_sequence_counter` group
  (`ProgramPacketSequenceCounter` — 7-bit counter,
  `MPEG1_MPEG2_identifier`, 6-bit `original_stuff_length`), the
  P-STD buffer pair (`PStdBuffer` — `scale` + 13-bit `size`, with a
  `size_bytes()` helper applying the §2.4.3.7 128-vs-1024-byte units
  rule), and the `PES_extension_flag_2` reserved bytes
  (`PES_extension_field_length`-prefixed, surfaced verbatim since
  every body byte is `reserved` in this edition of the spec). Each
  absent sub-flag maps to `None`; truncation anywhere inside the
  extension is a `TsError::Truncated` naming the exact field; the
  three reserved bits in the sub-flag byte are ignored on read. This
  completes the Table 2-17 optional PES header — every syntax element
  from the `'10'` marker through the stuffing bytes now has a typed
  decode.
- `TargetBackgroundGridDescriptor` — typed view of the §2.6.12
  target_background_grid_descriptor (tag `0x07`, Table 2-49). Surfaces
  the four-byte body as the 14-bit `horizontal_size`, the 14-bit
  `vertical_size` (both grid dimensions in pixels per §2.6.13), and the
  4-bit `aspect_ratio_information` (the raw H.262 / ISO/IEC 13818-2
  aspect-ratio code, which this crate does not further decode). The
  table carries no reserved bits, so all 32 payload bits are read; both
  size fields are big-endian and span a byte boundary in the middle of
  the body. Bodies shorter than four bytes fall back to
  `DescriptorBody::Raw`. Wired through `PmtStream::iter_descriptors` and
  `ProgramMapTable::iter_program_descriptors` alongside the existing tag
  set. The paired §2.6.14 video_window_descriptor (tag `0x08`) that
  places a stream's window on this grid is now also decoded.
- `IbpDescriptor` — typed view of the §2.6.34 IBP_descriptor (tag
  `0x12`, Table 2-61). Surfaces the two-byte body as `closed_gop_flag`,
  `identical_gop_flag`, and the 14-bit `max_gop_length` (big-endian,
  packed against the LSB of the leading byte). Spec §2.6.35 forbids
  `max_gop_length == 0`; the parser still surfaces the value rather
  than dropping it, and exposes the well-formed predicate via
  `IbpDescriptor::is_well_formed` so callers can detect malformed
  streams. Bodies shorter than the two-byte fixed payload fall back
  to `DescriptorBody::Raw`. Wired through `PmtStream::iter_descriptors`
  and `ProgramMapTable::iter_program_descriptors` alongside the
  existing tag set.
- `MultiplexBufferUtilizationDescriptor` — typed view of the §2.6.22
  multiplex_buffer_utilization_descriptor (tag `0x0C`, Table 2-55).
  Surfaces the four-byte body as `bound_valid_flag`,
  `ltw_offset_lower_bound`, and `ltw_offset_upper_bound`. Both bounds
  are 15-bit values in units of 90 kHz clock periods (the LTW_offset
  unit defined in §2.4.3.4). Reserved bits on byte 2 are ignored on
  the read path so a non-zero reservation doesn't corrupt the parse;
  bodies shorter than four bytes fall back to `DescriptorBody::Raw`.
  Wired through `PmtStream::iter_descriptors` and
  `ProgramMapTable::iter_program_descriptors` alongside the existing
  tag set. The 15-bit upper-bound width follows the §2.6.23 semantic
  text (which describes the field as 15-bit) and the adaptation-field
  `ltw_offset` width in §2.4.3.4; the Table 2-55 syntax row's 14-bit
  label leaves the body summing to 31 bits, which can't terminate on
  a clean byte boundary, so the 15-bit reading is the consistent one.
- `HierarchyDescriptor` + `HierarchyType` — typed view of the §2.6.6
  hierarchy_descriptor (tag `0x04`, Table 2-43). Surfaces the
  four-byte body — `hierarchy_type` (Table 2-44, full 8-variant
  mapping for the 1..7 + 15 named values plus `Reserved(u8)` for the
  Table 2-44 `0` / `8..=14` reserved range), `hierarchy_layer_index`,
  `hierarchy_embedded_layer_index` (undefined per §2.6.7 when the
  type is `BaseLayer` — `HierarchyType::is_base_layer()` flags that
  case), and `hierarchy_channel`. Reserved bits on every byte are
  masked off on the read path so a non-zero reservation doesn't
  corrupt the parse; bodies shorter than four bytes fall back to
  `DescriptorBody::Raw`. Wired through `PmtStream::iter_descriptors`
  and `ProgramMapTable::iter_program_descriptors` alongside the
  existing tag set.
- `CopyrightDescriptor` — typed view of the §2.6.24
  copyright_descriptor (tag `0x0D`, Table 2-56). Surfaces the 32-bit
  `copyright_identifier` (issued by the §2.9 Registration Authority)
  plus the trailing `additional_copyright_info` byte slice (whose
  semantics are scoped to the assignee of the identifier per §2.6.25
  and stay opaque to this crate). Bodies shorter than the 4-byte
  fixed identifier fall back to `DescriptorBody::Raw`. Wired through
  `PmtStream::iter_descriptors` and
  `ProgramMapTable::iter_program_descriptors` alongside the existing
  tag set.
- `SmoothingBufferDescriptor` — typed view of the §2.6.30
  smoothing_buffer_descriptor (tag `0x10`, Table 2-59). Surfaces the
  raw 22-bit `sb_leak_rate` and `sb_size` fields plus convenience
  helpers `leak_rate_bits_per_second` (× 400 — same as
  `maximum_bitrate_descriptor`'s units), `leak_rate_bytes_per_second`
  (× 50), and `buffer_size_bytes` (identity, since `sb_size` is
  already in bytes per §2.6.31). Bodies shorter than the six-byte
  fixed payload fall back to `DescriptorBody::Raw`; reserved bits on
  the two header bytes are ignored on the read path so a non-zero
  reservation doesn't corrupt the parse. Wired through
  `PmtStream::iter_descriptors` and `ProgramMapTable::iter_program_descriptors`
  alongside the existing tag set.
- `PsiSectionAssembler` — per-PID stateful reassembler that joins a
  PSI section across multiple 188-byte TS packets per ISO/IEC 13818-1
  §2.4.4. Feeds on `(payload, pusi, continuity_counter)` tuples and
  yields complete `Vec<u8>` sections that run from `table_id` through
  the CRC trailer (the same shape every `Parse::parse` consumes).
  Enforces: §2.4.4.1 `pointer_field` semantics (PUSI=1 finishes the
  previous in-flight section, then starts new ones), §2.4.4 stuffing
  byte termination (`0xFF` table_id ends iteration within one
  payload), §2.4.4 1024-byte cap (`MAX_PSI_SECTION_LEN`), §2.4.3.3
  CC-skip detection (an unexpected continuity_counter discards the
  in-flight buffer rather than concatenating misordered bytes), and
  back-to-back sections in a single payload. The demuxer's PAT and
  PMT discovery loops now drive a `PsiSectionAssembler` each, so a
  PMT whose descriptor block exceeds the ~184-byte single-TS payload
  budget (common with multi-language PGS + multi-codec audio + a
  rich registration descriptor) is reassembled correctly across as
  many continuation packets as the section spans.
- `ConditionalAccessTable` — parser for §2.4.4.6 / Table 2-27 (CAT,
  `table_id == 0x01` on PID `0x0001`). Exposes
  `version_number` / `current_next_indicator` /
  `section_number` / `last_section_number` plus the carried
  descriptor() loop via `iter_descriptors`, which lifts CA_descriptor
  entries (tag 0x09) into the existing typed
  `DescriptorBody::Ca { ca_system_id, ca_pid, private_data }` shape.
- `CAT_TABLE_ID` (0x01), `PAT_PID` (0x0000), `CAT_PID` (0x0001) and
  `MAX_PSI_SECTION_LEN` constants — every fixed value §2.4.4 wires
  to a normative PID or upper bound is now a named export.
- `PesPacket` now surfaces every optional PES-header field defined in
  ISO/IEC 13818-1 §2.4.3.7 / Table 2-17 beyond PTS+DTS: the five
  flags1 bits (`pes_scrambling_control`, `pes_priority`,
  `data_alignment_indicator`, `copyright`, `original_or_copy`) plus
  the flag-gated bodies `escr_27mhz` (42-bit ESCR_base × 300 +
  ESCR_extension), `es_rate_50bps` (22-bit ES_rate), `dsm_trick_mode`
  (raw 8-bit byte), `additional_copy_info` (7-bit), and
  `previous_pes_packet_crc` (16-bit). The PES_extension_flag is
  preserved as a `pes_extension_present` bool; its sub-fields stay
  inside the `PES_header_data_length` budget and are skipped past
  with the rest of the optional area. A truncated optional body
  (e.g. `PTS_DTS_flags = 0b11` but `PES_header_data_length = 5`)
  surfaces as `TsError::Truncated`.
- `clock` module — per-PCR-PID PCR recovery, time-base discontinuity
  detection (signalled via `discontinuity_indicator` per §2.4.3.5 *or*
  detected by an unsignalled PCR jump beyond a configurable jitter
  window), and per-sample jitter / instantaneous-bitrate readings.
  Sibling `ContinuityTracker` classifies each TS packet on a PID
  against §2.4.3.3 (continuous / spec-permitted duplicate / no-payload
  carrier / dropped / signalled discontinuity), enforcing the
  one-duplicate-per-CC cap.
- `descriptor` module — generic ISO/IEC 13818-1 §2.6 TLV walker plus
  typed decoders for `registration` (0x05), `ISO_639_language` (0x0A),
  `CA` (0x09), `video_stream` (0x02), `audio_stream` (0x03),
  `AVC_video` (0x28), and `HEVC_video` (0x38).
- Four additional §2.6 descriptor decoders surfaced as typed bodies:
  `data_stream_alignment_descriptor` (0x06, §2.6.10),
  `system_clock_descriptor` (0x0B, §2.6.20),
  `maximum_bitrate_descriptor` (0x0E, §2.6.26 — with a
  `bits_per_second()` convenience), and
  `STD_descriptor` (0x11, §2.6.32).
- `ProgramMapTable::iter_program_descriptors` and
  `PmtStream::iter_descriptors` convenience accessors that walk the
  PMT's program-info / per-ES descriptor blocks.
- `AdaptationField` now decodes every optional field in §2.4.3.4 /
  Table 2-6 beyond PCR: `opcr_base` / `opcr_extension` (OPCR coded
  identically to PCR), signed `splice_countdown`, `transport_private_data`
  (length-prefixed byte slice), and an `adaptation_field_extension`
  body with `ltw_valid_flag` + `ltw_offset`, 22-bit `piecewise_rate`,
  and 33-bit `dts_next_au` with 4-bit `splice_type` from the
  seamless-splice sub-field. Reserved padding inside the extension is
  silently skipped; a truncated extension surfaces as
  `TsError::Truncated`.
